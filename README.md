The Basic React Todo List Application is a simple yet functional project developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This application offers users the ability to create a list of tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed.

Key Features:

**Task Input Field:** The application provides a text input field where users can type and add new tasks to the todo list.

**Add Button:** Users can click the "Add" button or press Enter after typing a task to add it to the todo list.

**Todo List Display:** The application dynamically displays the list of tasks added by the user. Each task is shown with a checkbox for marking completion and the task text itself.

**Strikethrough for Completed Tasks:** When a user marks a task as completed by checking the checkbox, the corresponding task text is visually indicated as completed by applying a strikethrough style.

**Delete Button:** Next to each task, there is a delete button that allows users to remove tasks from the todo list.

**Usage:**

**Adding Tasks:** Users can type a task in the input field and click the "Add" button or press Enter to add it to the todo list.

Marking Tasks as Completed: Users can click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. The task text will then be displayed with a strikethrough style to indicate completion.

**Deleting Tasks: **To remove a task from the list, users can click the delete button next to the task.
